                Malayalees were part of the Delaware social fabric since the 70's. Madhavan uncle, Susheela Aunty and Kurien uncle settled in Delaware 3 decades ago. And since the expansion of global economy there have been more and more Malayalees migrating to America and in tune to that more Malayalee families started settling in Delaware. 
                Thanks to the friendly and welcoming social neighbourhood of Delaware and the establishment of many Banking sector jobs in the area, number of malayalees in Delaware has been always increasing. The need for a formal association to promote our culture and to interact with other malayalee families in Delaware was always a dream of many folks in and around Delaware.  A first meet was held on January 2nd 2010 at Taste of India restaurant on Kirkwood highway. Jijo Joseph, Joe Paul, Glady helped organize the first meeting.. Below is the meeting minutes prepared by Jijo Joseph which laid the foundation for forming a Malayalee Association in Delaware and anointing it as 'DELMA'.

							Dear Friends,
							 </br>
							First of all, let me make apologies for  being late in sending this email . Had some issues at work . “ aadyam ariprasnam pinne pothukaryam”.   I hope all agree with me .. J 
							 </br>
							We had 19 families(~50 people)  that  showed up on Jan 2nd for the Malayalee get together  and lunch.  Jose and Gladdy deserve applause for setting up the venue and sending the message to everyone and taking this initiative.   From the General discussion  it was very clear that everyone wanted to have a Malayalee get together  in Delaware. Those who could not make it on Jan 2nd also assured full support .
							</br>
							<blockquote>
							<b>
							The presence and advice of  Senior Delaware  Malayalees like Kochumadhavan uncle, Susheela aunti and  Dr Kurian  were really encouraging. We will keep the momentum going …
							</b>
							</blockquote>
							11/19 families showed interest in working as committee members and we have a few others also who could not make  it on Jan 2nd .  
							</br>
							Let me point out what we discussed: 
							</br>
							1)      Forming a Malayalee Association in Delaware  - Everyone was in an agreement that we will have  planned activities for one year   and then  make a decision on whether to formally register it as a nonprofit organization  or not .
							</br>
							2)      Jayesh volunteered to check a few names suitable for the association and to see whether that is available 
							<blockquote>
							<i><b>( few names came up like delma – Delaware Malayalee association or delma_na  etc .. we don’t want to go for  MAD or KAD … J . Anyway we have time  but feel free to suggest names
							</b></i>
							</blockquote>
							
							3)      Getting the contact details of Malayalees in Delaware – We have more than 100 families here in DE .   All are requested  to send  the information of their Malayalee  contacts to   Jose   and or to myself to  make a database and a  Google or yahoo group which can be used for controlled communication. Please use the attached form to send that info to us.  Currently the emails are being forwarded to  others but no central database to inform the planned activities.  So, if you did not fill  that info sheet on Jan 2nd , Please fill the attached form with your contact info and  send back to us (jijojoseph@comcast.net; arakkal@hotmail.com)
							</br>
							4)      Funds- We talked about funds but since we don’t have any urgent requirements , we decided to discuss it later
							</br>
							5)      Planned activities in 2010
							</br>
							 Picnic -  (May/June)  - <b><i>Manoj, Sreekumar,Jaison and Anto </b></i>Volunteered for this event to find a place and arrangements etc.
							Onam celebration – (August/September)<b><i>Sushila aunty, Reena, Roselyn and Chitra</b></i>(not present but agreed)  volunteered to check with the temple and a backup place in case needed.  We were enjoying the Onam in the temple since years. Credit goes to many people in the temple. Let us see whether we can still do it there with a larger audience. Date  will be announced later.
							Xmas/NewYear  (Dec . Jan) – Need to discuss this in next committee meeting. I am thinking more towards a Holiday Banquet and we can have the General body meeting . Open for committee discussion
							</br>
							6)      Election – The best decision of the day was this ... No election . All are Presidents,    Actually we are all Volunteers .
							</br>
							There will be a separate email going out to committee members  with our next scheduled committee meeting invitation in February.
							</br>
							Note:  I am testing a  yahoo group called delma_na  and if it works as expected, I will be sending that invitation to all  and please accept it
							</br>
							Please let me know if I missed anything …. 
							</br>
							Thanks
							Jijo
